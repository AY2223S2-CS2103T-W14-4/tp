## Overview

HMHero is a tool that helps Hiring Managers easily track the statuses of candidates' applications.

In a conventional application cycle, the large influx of applicants makes it challenging for Hiring Managers to track and monitor the progress of each applicant. This application includes features such as quick searching of applicants, algorithm to prioritize applicants according to their strengths and tabs on every applicant's application status.

| Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.                                                                           |
| Items in square brackets are optional.<br>e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.                                                                                                           |
| Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` `, `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.                                                                           |
| Parameters can be in any order.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.                                                                                              |
| If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken. |
| Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.                     |
