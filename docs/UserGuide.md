## 1. Overview

HMHero is a tool that helps Hiring Managers easily track the statuses of candidates' applications.

In a conventional application cycle, the large influx of applicants makes it challenging for
Hiring Managers to track and monitor the progress of each applicant. This application includes
features such as quick searching of applicants, algorithm to prioritize applicants according
to their strengths and tabs on every applicant's application status.

## 6. Quick Reference Guide
This section covers everything you should know about HMHero, as well as a [tutorial]() on trying your first command.
Of special note is the [Key Definitions]() and [Command Format]() sections, which covers essential knowledge to using
HMHero's features.

### 6.1 Layout
When you launch HMHero, HMHero appears on your screen as a [Graphical User Interface](GUI). Let's explore the
layout of the different components of HMHero.

HMHero's GUI consists of a single main window consisting of 3 main sections.
1. Command Input Box
2. Command Result Box
3. Applicant List Box

The following picture of the main window shows the three components, numbered accordingly:
![components.png](images%2Fcomponents.png)

Besides the main window, HMHero also has the Help Window. It is not part of the main GUI and is only
shown after a [Help Command]() is run.

The Help Window looks like the following:

![help_window.png](images%2Fhelp_window.png)

### 6.2 Key Definitions

#### 6.2.1 Applicant

An applicant in HMHero represents an individual that applied for a job at your company. HMHero tracks various
attributes of an applicant. Compulsory attributes would include their name, phone number, address and email.

The following are the attributes stored for each `Applicant`
* Name
* Phone Number
* Address
* Email
* Notes

Applicants are unique by name and phone number and Case Sensitive.
This means you cannot add two or more applicants of the same name and phone number.

### 6.2.2 Notes

A note in HMHero serves as a means of labelling the skills of an applicant. These tags
are unique and case-sensitive.

We can tag multiple applicants with the same note and each applicant can have multiple notes. These notes
are optional.

Feel free to make use of notes as you fit to highlight skill-sets of an applicant. Examples of such notes
can include:
* Highlight applicant's:
  * Technical proficiency, e.g. `Python`, `Java`, `Flask`
  * Soft Skills, e.g. `Project Management`, `Event Planning`

HMHero's Notes are unique by name and are case-sensitive. This means you cannot add two or more notes of
the same name.

### 6.2.3 Flags
Flags are delimiters that enable HMHero to distinguiseh different parameters without ambiguity.

You could put in the corresponding [Placeholder](#624-placeholders) immediately after each flag.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert">:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong>
You may find the following image taken from the subsequent <a href> Command Format </a> section helpful:
<img src="/Users/merrick/Documents/NUS/Y2S2/CS2103T/tp/docs/images/CommandExample.png">
</div>

Placeholders in this User Guide refers to the UPPER_CASE words that can be replaced by valid user input supplied.
These placeholders follow immediately after a [Flag](#623-flags).

| Action | Corresponding Placeholder |
|--------|---------------------------|
| n/     | `NAME`                    |
| p/     | `PHONE`                   |
| e/     | `EMAIL`                   |
| a/     | `ADDRESS`                 |
| note/  | `NOTE`                    |
| d/     | `DATETIME`                |

Please refer to the subsequent [Command Format]() section to see how [Flags](#623-flags)
and [Placeholders](#624-placeholders) are used together.

### 6.2.4 Placeholders
Placeholders in this User Guide refers to the UPPER_CASE words that can be replaced by valid user input supplied.
These placeholders follow immediately after a [Flag](#623-flags).

Please refer to the subsequent [Command Format](#63-command-format) section to see how Flags and Placeholders are used together.

| Placeholder  | Corresponding Flag | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| INDEX        | (Not Applicable)   | The INDEX of an item is the number to the left of the applicant's name in the Item List Box. |
| NAME         | n/                 | The NAME is the name we use to identify an Applicant.                                        |
| PHONE        | p/                 | The PHONE is the text we use to represent the phone number of the Applicant.                 |
| EMAIL        | e/                 | The EMAIL is the text we use to represent the email of the Applicant.                        |
| NOTE         | note/              | The NOTE is the term we use to identify a skill of an Applicant.                             |
| DATETIME     | d/                 | The DATETIME is the datetime indicating the interview datetime of the Applicant.             |

### 6.3 Command Format
You will encounter HMHero commands throughout this User Guide.
Before you delve into the different commands in Commands, letâ€™s learn what a command consists of.

Here is an example:
![CommandExample.png](images%2FCommandExample.png)
A command consists of:
Command Word: Tells HMHero what action you wish to execute. These actions are covered in [Commands]().
[Flags](#623-flags): Distinguishes between inputs. A flag is usually followed by a placeholder.
[Placeholders](#624-placeholders): Represents data that you wish to input. Replace this with valid data. 
For example, ITEM_NAME in n/ITEM_NAME can be replaced with n/Potato.

## 6.4 Trying your first command

To get you more familiar with HMHero, let's practice executing some commands.

To start off, letâ€™s try out the `add` command! This command lets you add an [Applicant]() to HMHero.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [note/NOTES]`

**What does the format mean?**

The first word of every command allows HMHero to distinguish different commands
* add tells HMHero that this is the command to add an applicant into HMHero
* [Flags]() such as `n/` and `p/` are delimiters that enable HMHero to distinguish different parameters
supplied by you without ambiguity
* [Placeholders]() such as NAME and PHONE shows you what you should place in each portion of the command

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong>
The <a href="#624-placeholders">Placeholders </a> section covers the restrictions for respective placeholders.
For example, the datetime format for interviews, certain characters you cannot
use and the limit and precision of numbers.
</div>

**Let's try an example**

Suppose we want to add John Doe into our HMHero tracker. We have a list of his particulars
and we want to record them down.

`NAME`: John Doe

`PHONE`: 91234567

`EMAIL`: john@gmail.com

`ADDRESS`: SoC COM 1

The command to enter into the command box would be:
```agsl
add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/john@gmail.com a/SoC COM 1
```

The example above provides all the required fields to add an applicant
- What if we wanted to also note down some key skillsets for John?

We could edit our command to include it!
```agsl
add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/john@gmail.com a/SoC COM 1 notes/Java notes/Python
```

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert">:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong>
We can provide any number of notes to an applicant! Just ensure each NOTE is preceded by
the note/ prefix.
</div>

| Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.                                                                           |

| Items with `â€¦â€‹` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as ` `, `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.                                                                           |
| Parameters can be in any order.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.                                                                                              |
| If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken. |
| Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.                     |
