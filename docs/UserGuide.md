| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.                                                                           |
| Items in square brackets are optional.<br>e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.                                                                                                           |
| Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` `, `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.                                                                           |
| Parameters can be in any order.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.                                                                                              |
| If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken. |
| Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.                     |
